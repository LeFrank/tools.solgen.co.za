Online learning

Key assumptions:
	Case 1. Traditional institutions, e.g. usual structures, administration >  faculties > academics > students
	Case 2. Private: Training/educating company ( CompA ) > instructor > company recieving trainning ( CompB ) > management ( CompB management enrolling and managing CompB emps/students ) > employees/student ( CompB staff recieving training. )
	Case 3. Company to student: Institution > trainer/lecturer > student
	Case 4. Lectuerer 2 Student ( Master, Apprentice pattern ): Person seeks methods of create content to train student. 

OCs situation:
	- case 1. We are very knowledgable and capable
	- case 2. one client is catered for, but new business requests we are not able to support because of a conflict/ mismatch of the clients funds and requirements
	- case 3. no tools/services or tools
	- case 4. no tools/services or tools


	Strategy:
		To porovide the modern students with the tools and services they need to succeed.
		To provide academics with tools and services to manage their:
			- their classes
				- who
				- where
				- when
			- their time
				- mmmm - stretch
			- their content
				- that belongs to them
				- CREATE & UPDATE content 
					- should be able to re-use
				- easily migratable
				- store/ warehouse/ archive
				- sharable
				- 
			- their statistics
			- their students
			- their communication with 
				- students
				- peers
				- administrators
				- public
		To provide administrators with the tools and services to be able to
			- enrollment
				- process student applications
					- storing all relevant information
						- identifying info
						- location info
							- address
						- banking info
						- next of kin
					- successful
					- unsucessful
						- retaining this information

				- process student registration
					- financials information
					- what will they be studying
					- what access and permissions do they require
					- relationship parameters
						- how long will the relationship be for?
						- communication methods
						- ...

			- fullfillment 
				- track student progress
				- track student participation
				- track outputs, e.g. pass rate, faculty representations, demographics, success/ failure conditions
				- provide students access to fascilities and materials
				- communicate with students
				- issue grades
				- issue certificates
				- store grades and transcript information securely
				- provide assessment tools and services
				- provide proof / validation of study outcomes
				- accept and respond to requests from faculty, students and academics

		Termination of the relationship
			- cancellation but with retention of student history with institution
			- graduation, migration of relationship to alumni
			- persisting/ publishing outputs such as research papers or pratical outputs , engineering
			- keeping contact information updated.




So the major pillars of Online eduction consist of:
	0. Getting lecturers into the system ( no tool in OC )
	1. Creating curriculum/courses/ short courses data ( VSS )
	1.1. Creating CM in a concrete way, in an LMS
	2. Creating content - HUGE DEMAND AND VARIATION  ( Xerte, LMS - Sakai/Moodle/ etc )
	3. Enrolling students ( VSS )
	4. Getting payment ( no tool in OC )
	5. Getting the students into the system ( Integrations )
	6. Linking staff to courses ( LMS + Integrations + LDAP etc)
		- with correct permissions ( LDAP/AD/LMS )
	7. Linking students to courses ( LMS + Integrations / Manual )
		- with correct permissions ( LDAP/AD/LMS )
	8. Student and lecturer journey begins and proceeds till completion.
		see fullfillment above ( LMS )


Specific to Online / Gaps we need to fill.
	- self registration  [ no tool in OC ]
	- online payment/refunds  [ no tool in OC ]
	- reminders and interventions [ no tool in OC ]
	- tracking and deep stats ( access to system, did access material, completed assessments, validation of course material ) [ no tool in OC , partial in LMS ]
	- selecting courses ( single subject 1 week  to 6 months ) [ no tool in OC ]
	- digital content distribution [ no tool in OC ]
	- digital certification [ no tool in OC ]
	- storage of submissions and output [ no tool in OC ]
	- creating online content consumable by mobile and fixed devices ( laptops, desktops, other ) [ partially provided by LMS ]
	- overview of process for all roleplayers.
		- student, how are they doing submissions on time and of good quality.
			- ultimately of grades [ partially provided by LMS ]
		- academics, who is the class, how are they progressing, 
			are they consuming the content, are they understanding content and instructions, are students keeping up, which students need help/ guidance, communicating with students [ partially provided by LMS ]
	Offline capability [ Synthesis / Moodle ] limited interest.
